## üî¨ Dynamic Scoring Algorithm

### Response Analysis Factors
1. **Length Score** (30% weight)
   - Word count analysis
   - Detailed responses score higher
   - Minimum 10 words for basic scoring

2. **Depth Score** (25% weight)
   - Reasoning indicators: "because", "therefore", "however"
   - Examples: "for instance", "experience", "situation"
   - Analytical thinking: "analyze", "evaluate", "compare"

3. **Thoroughness Score** (25% weight)
   - Question-type specific completeness
   - Sequential thinking: "first", "second", "then"
   - Process orientation: "step", "phase", "method"

4. **Factual Accuracy** (35% weight)
   - Evidence-based claims: "research shows", "data suggests"
   - Specific metrics and numbers
   - Real-world validation (future: API integration)

### Dimension Alignment
