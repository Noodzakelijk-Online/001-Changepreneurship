## Sample Responses Preview

### "Why do you want to become an entrepreneur?"
> "After 8 years in corporate product management, I have identified a persistent pain point that existing solutions fail to address effectively. Remote team collaboration tools lack intelligent automation and proactive insights. I want to build a solution that genuinely helps distributed teams work better. Additionally, I am seeking more autonomy in decision-making and the ability to directly impact user outcomes without corporate bureaucracy."

### "What problem are you solving?"
> "Remote teams waste 15-20 hours per week on communication overhead, status updates, and context switching. Existing project management tools (Asana, Jira, Monday) are passive databases that require constant manual updates. Teams lack proactive insights about blockers, risks, or workload imbalances until it is too late. This leads to missed deadlines, burnout, and poor collaboration quality."

### "What evidence do you have of product-market fit?"
> "Strong PMF signals: (1) Sean Ellis test - 85% would be 'very disappointed' if product disappeared (>40% = PMF). (2) Organic growth - 6 referrals without asking, 3 companies signed up from word-of-mouth. (3) Paid conversion - 4/15 beta customers started paying before we asked. (4) Usage intensity - 77% weekly active users, typical SaaS is 30-40%. (5) Retention - 0 churn in 2 months. (6) Qualitative - 'I cannot imagine going back' feedback from multiple users."
